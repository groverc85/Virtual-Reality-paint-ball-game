1. Add score and timer field to make this game more challenging. Player can get one point each time when he/she hits the target(marker), it\'92s not the best approach to launch balls as fast as you can because of certain collisions. In the meantime, timers will start from 0 and count to 2 mins. At 2 mins, you\'92ll no longer be able to hit the wall.\
2. Use swipe speed to determine the initial speed of the balls, instead of using constant speed}
